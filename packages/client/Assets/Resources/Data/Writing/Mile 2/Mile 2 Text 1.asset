  text: "The chieftain Brennus, leading twenty thousand Gallic warriors, would shatter
    the legions marshalled outside Rome\u2019s walls, inflicting a trauma that would
    haunt the city and its empire for centuries. Victorious, the Gauls paused on
    the battlefield to honour Toutatis, god of the dead and father of the universe.
    The head, the centre of the soul and man\u2019s power were hacked from the shoulders
    of senators, patricians, and plebians alike. With these blood-stained spoils
    now hanging from the necks of their horses, the Gauls sang paeans to their gods
    before storming the city and pillaging it unopposed. \r\n"
